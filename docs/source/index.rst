Welcome to GenomePrep documentation!
===================================

**GenomePrep** is a Python library for genetics enthusiasts 
that prepare direct-to-consumer DNA data for analysis with cutting-edge bioinformatics tools.

It was developed on the goodwill of open genome data, addresses the problem of processing raw DTC DNA data in the context of the present: genotype arrays, and offers several *simple* and *intuitive* scripts.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
